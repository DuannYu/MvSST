# Scalable and Parameter-Free Fusion Graph Learning for Multi-View Clustering

This is the official implementation of our Neurocomputing [paper](https://github.com/DuannYu/MvSST/blob/master/assets/paper.pdf).

Run `demo.m` to reproduce our results. The hyperparameters are preset.

If you use our code, please cite our work. :)
